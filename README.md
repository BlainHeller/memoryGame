Title: 
Lunch Menu Memory

About: 
A fast food themed game of memory! Lunch Menu Memory is a web browser-based game, written primarily in JavaScript, featuring original pixel art.

Game Objective: 
The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards. 

How to Play: 
The Lunch Menu Memory game’s playboard consists of eight (8) gamecards. At the beginning of the game, all cards are placed face-down to conceal their identity to the player. During each turn, the player selects two (2) cards. During the player’s turn, two (2) selected cards are turned face-up, revealing the cards identity. 

If the cards do not match, they are flipped back over to face-down. If the selected cards match, the player is awarded a point, and the matching cards are removed from the playboard. The card pair must consist of two (2) identical face-value cards. For example, if the two cards selected each have the same image of a cheeseburger, that would be a matching pair. However, if the cards selected features one card a cheeseburger and the other card with a hotdog, the card would not be considered a matching pair and they would be returned face-down to the playboard.

The game ends when all pairs of gamecards have been discovered and the playboard is cleared of gamecards.
